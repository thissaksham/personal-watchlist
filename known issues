current time: 1st jan 3:50am IST
i added a show which is about to premiere its season 5 last episode at 6:30am IST.
when i added the show and select S5 in the modal, it correctly partially marked the S5 bubble and below that it's written ongoing
but, the show has gone in watched and it does not display the upcoming date on upcoming page
FYI: tmdb might return last air date as 31st december as it gives dates in UTC or ET timing i guess
